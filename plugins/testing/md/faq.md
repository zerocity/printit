# FAQS

    What class of ships ? 
        
        - Fighter (Prior. 1)
        - Frigate (Future)
        - Cruiser (Future)
        - Battleship (Future)

    What is size ?
        size basically is the size of the ship in cm times the scale of the battle.
        A fighter can be 1 or 10cm big, just as you wish, 
        a battleship will always be around 8-10 times larger than the fighter though.
        We will eventually settle on a fixed scale depending of the minimum printable shipsize.
